        <h3 class="fs-3">What's the difference between var, let and const keywords in JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in JavaScript.The scope of the var keyword is the global
            or
            function scope. It means variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally. <br>The let
            keyword is
            an improved version of the var keyword. The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It can’t be
            accessible
            outside the particular block. <br>The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let
            keyword,
            except the user cannot update it.When users declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise,
            it
            returns an error. The user cannot update the const variable once it is declared.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-3">What's the difference between regular functions and arrow functions</h3>
        <p>Arrow functions – a new feature introduced in ES6 – enable writing concise functions in JavaScript. While
            both
            regular and arrow functions work in a similar manner, yet there are certain interesting differences between
            them.Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own (this)keyword.Arguments objects are not
            available in arrow functions, but are available in regular functions.Regular functions created using
            function
            declarations or expressions are ‘constructible’ and ‘callable’. Since regular functions are constructible,
            they
            can be called using the ‘new’ keyword. However, the arrow functions are only ‘callable’ and not
            constructible.
            Thus, we will get a run-time error on trying to construct a non-constructible arrow functions using the new
            keyword.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-3">What's the difference between find, filter, map and foreach?</h3>
        <p>The find() method is used to find all the descendant elements of the selected element. It finds the element
            in
            the DOM tree by traversing through the root to leaf. <br> The filter() method is used to filters all the
            elements and returns the element that matches and the element that do not match are removed. <br>.map()
            executes
            the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
            <br>.forEach(), is
            used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns
            undefined.
        </p>
        <h3 class="fs-3">Why we use templete string?</h3>
        <p>What are template strings used for?
            Template literals (template strings) allow you to use strings or embedded expressions in the form of a
            string.
            They are enclosed in backticks `` .</p>
